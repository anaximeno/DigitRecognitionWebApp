# The Digit Recognition Web App

This is a Web Application that can recognize which numbers were drawn by you. It uses Machine Learning, actually, Deep Learning Techniques for predicting (determining) which number you have drawn on the canvas. It was made using two python frameworks for Machine Learning Tensorflow and Keras, and another JavaScript framework for Machine Learning the **TensorflowJS**.  
  
If you want to learn Machine Learning on Javascript with TensorflowJS I recommend the book from ***Juan De Dios Santos Rivera, "Practical TensorFlow JS - Learning Development"***, or if you want to learn about Deep Learning I recommend the free Web Book from ***Michael A. Nielsen, "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", Determination Press, 2015***, read the web version at [neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com](https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

## Training of the Model

The model used on the **Digit Recognition Web App** was trained with Tensorflow and Keras then converted to TensorflowJS a Javascript implemetation of Tensorflow.
