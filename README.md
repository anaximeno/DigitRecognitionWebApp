# The Digit Recognition Web App - Which Digit

This is a Web Application that can recognize which numbers were drawn by the user on the canvas. For making this, it uses Deep Learning techniques to predict the resulting images. It was trained using two python frameworks for Machine Learning: Tensorflow, and Keras. To deploy the model, another framework for JavaScript was used then, the TensorflowJS. To test the web application click the link below:
