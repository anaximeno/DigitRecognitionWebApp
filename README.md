# The Digit Recognition Web App

This Web Application can recognize which numbers were drawn by you. For doing this it uses Machine Learning, actually Deep Learning, techniques for predicting (determining) which number were drawn by you on the canvas. It was trained (*we refer to training as the way our model learn to predict correctly the given inputs*) using two python frameworks for Machine Learning and Deep Learning, **Tensorflow** and **Keras**, and another JavaScript framework which was used for inference (something like using a pre-trained model to make predictions), the **TensorflowJS**. If you want to test the web application, just click the link below:
